Some really reasonable setup for React applications, no overhead and tons of libraries. 
Inspired by [React Redux Starter Kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit) but more minimal and less opinionated.
With small overhead, HMR is lightning fast, no stuttering and waiting any more!

## Installation

You need NodeJS, obviously : ).

1. git clone `https://github.com/radenkovic/react-vanilla my-app`
2. `cd my-app`
3. `yarn`
4. `yarn dev`


## Project Structure

Source files for the react app are in folder `/src`. Feel free to change the structure. 
Redux is also only loosely connected, so it can be easily and safely removed from `main.js` file (remove `<Provider>` wrapper and `createStore`).

Routes folder is for App Routes, where `rootComponent.js` (in the directory root) is to declare main Routes for the app.

You can read more about proper structure [here](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit#project-structure).

## Public folder

If you want to use plain images, load fonts via url and so on, place them in `/src/static` folder, then you can include them, for example:

`/src/static/vanilla.jpg` = `<img src="/static/vanilla.jpg" />`

## Builds

Distribution build can be made with:

- `npm run build`

It cleans `dist` directory and creates fresh app version.
